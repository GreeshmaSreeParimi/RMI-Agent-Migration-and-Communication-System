The project involves an agent-based system facilitating migration and communication between host machines via RMI. Agents can hop between machines, deposit and retrieve messages, and execute methods independently. Test agents demonstrate inter-agent communication and movement across designated destinations.

Concepts and Technologies used:
1. Java Remote Method Invocation (RMI)
2. Multi-threading in Java
3. Serialization and Deserialization in Java

Uses:
1. Scalability: RMI enables seamless communication between Java objects running on different JVMs, allowing for scalable distributed applications.
2. Efficient Resource Utilization: Multi-threading optimizes resource utilization by enabling concurrent execution of tasks, enhancing system performance.
3. Flexibility: Serialization facilitates the transfer of Java objects between hosts, enabling mobility and flexibility in agent migration across distributed systems.
4. Inter-Agent Communication: Agents can deposit and retrieve messages using RMI, enabling indirect communication between agents residing on different machines.
5. Dynamic Host Migration: The system allows agents to migrate to different host machines based on specified functions or events, enhancing system adaptability and fault tolerance.
